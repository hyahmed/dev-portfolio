    "about": "I’m a fourth-year Biomechanical Engineering student at the University of British Columbia with hands-on experience in mechanical design, prototyping, and data-driven engineering. My work spans renewable energy systems, precision components, and medical devices, with a focus on translating theory into functional, testable designs. \n\n Through co-op and research experiences, I’ve developed strong technical skills in Python, MATLAB, CAD, and data analysis, alongside experience in project planning, team leadership, and clear technical documentation. I enjoy working at the intersection of design and integration, where complex problems can be broken down into practical engineering solutions. \n\n This portfolio highlights a selection of projects that reflect both my technical skills and my approach to engineering. Feel free to reach out at hya.engineering@gmail.com for inquiries or collaboration."
