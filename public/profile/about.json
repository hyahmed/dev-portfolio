    "about": "I’m a fourth-year Biomechanical Engineering student at the University of British Columbia, with experience spanning mechanical design, prototyping, and data-driven engineering. My projects range from renewable energy systems and precision components to medical devices. Through co-op and research experiences, I’ve developed skills in Python, MATLAB, CAD, root cause analysis, and data analysis, while learning to manage projects, lead teams, and document processes clearly. I’m particularly interested in designing and building systems that turn complex challenges into practical, testable solutions. \n\n This portfolio highlights a selection of projects that reflect both my technical skills and my approach to engineering. Feel free to reach out at hya.engineering@gmail.com for inquiries or collaboration."
